# AD-Security-Lab

## Objective
This project simulates a complete Active Directory (AD) security environment integrated with Splunk SIEM for log collection, attack detection, and incident response. It demonstrates both red team attacks and blue team detection techniques in a controlled lab setting.

## Skills Learned

#### Active Directory & Windows Security:
- Configured and managed AD domains, user accounts, permissions, and security policies.
#### Splunk SIEM
- Installed, configured, and used Splunk for log collection, searching, and dashboard creation.
#### Log Analysis
- Analyzed and interpreted Windows and network logs to detect suspicious activity.
#### Attack Understanding
- Learned attack techniques (brute force and Pass-the-Hash) and how to identify their indicators in logs.
#### Sigma Rule Writing
- Created Sigma rules for generic, SIEM-agnostic detection of attacks.
#### Cybersecurity Problem-Solving 
- Developed critical thinking and hands-on problem-solving skills in security monitoring and investigation.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
