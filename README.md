## Objective
This project simulates a complete Active Directory (AD) security environment integrated with Splunk SIEM for log collection, attack detection, and incident response. It demonstrates both red team attacks and blue team detection techniques in a controlled lab setting.
<br></br>


## Skills Learned

##### Active Directory & Windows Security:
- Configured and managed AD domains and user accounts.
##### Splunk SIEM
- Installed, configured, and used Splunk for log collection and searching.
##### Log Analysis
- Analyzed and interpreted Windows and network logs to detect suspicious activity.
##### Attack Understanding
- Learned attack techniques (brute force and Pass-the-Hash) and how to identify their indicators in logs.
##### Sigma Rule Writing
- Created Sigma rules for generic, SIEM-agnostic detection of attacks.
##### Cybersecurity Problem-Solving 
- Developed critical thinking and hands-on problem-solving skills in security monitoring and investigation.
<br></br>

## Tools Used

##### Windows Server & Windows 10: 
- Active Directory Domain Controller and client machine.
##### Ubuntu Server
- Hosting Splunk for log collection and analysis.
##### Splunk
- SIEM platform for log ingestion and searching.
##### Kali Linux
- Attacker machine for simulating attacks.
##### Sysmon
- Collecting and analyzing Windows security logs.
##### Sigma
- Generic detection rule framework for defining attack logic.
##### Crowbar
